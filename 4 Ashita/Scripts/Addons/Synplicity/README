Synplicity

Learns crafts you perform and allows you to repeat them. It is 
not as fancy as Crafty, and is not in the most user-friendly 
state as of yet, but it can currently learn crafts while it is
loaded (and forgets them when it is unloaded). You can then 
view the crafts it has learned and repeat them (given you have 
the materials for the craft). It will learn HQ crystal synths 
as though you used a standard crystal. It can also store all 
the possible results (HQ tiers) and show you all you have 
achieved thus far. Many features are missing at the moment but
it is stable for now so it seemed a good time to share.

For added feedback (debugging info) set __debug to true

Load Synplicity with
/addon load synplicity

Commands:

/syn show [filter]

Shows a list of all the crafts it has learned including info 
about known results. This will show you the index numbers.
Info is now presented with item names, and an optional 
(case-sensitive) filter may now be used to show only crafts
involving a particular item.

/syn do #

Repeats a synth with the given index number.
